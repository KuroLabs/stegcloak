StegCloak is open-source for people to contribute and improve it. It doesn't make use of any pre-existing algorithms or research. 
Characters 200c, 200d are widely mentioned in research in this field but with StegCloak, we the authors discovered that 2061, 2062, 2063, 2064
mathematical invisible characters achieve full invisibility in editors like Vim and in the whole world wide web. 
Apart from that, there are other unique additions like usage of two layers of compression and stream based AES-encryption. 
Thus this is original research and belongs to the original authors of the project and no one else.
